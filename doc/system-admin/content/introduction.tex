\subsection{INTENS -- an integrated engineering environment}
%           --------------------------------------------------
INTENS
is an integrated engineering environment with a graphical user interface
to combine
calculation programs with relational database systems.

Existing batch programs (or MATLAB functions) can be integrated without source code
modifications.

Changes and modifications in the engineering
processes are fully documented.

INTENS is dynamically configurable and
therefore easily adaptable to a variety of engineering processes.

INTENS is currently supported in the following environment:
\index{environments}
\begin{itemize}
\item the operating systems: Linux, Windows (Qt User Interface)
\item Docker, Kubernetes (Web Browser User Interface)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Purpose of this manual}
This manual provides information for configuring INTENS to specific needs.
It is written for administrators who have some familiarity with structured
programming languages such as C/C++, Python and the Linux operating system.
