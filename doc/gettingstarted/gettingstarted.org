#+title:  Getting Started with the INTENS Application Development
#+author: SEMAFOR Informatik & Energie AG, Basel, Switzerland
#+OPTIONS: ^:nil


* Overview
# Software development is expensive, time consuming and prone to error.
INTENS is an integration and development framework and runtime
platform for scientific
applications providing key benefits in a fast and effective way:

- Usability, traceability, data consistency
- Calculation module integration
- Variant evaluation and comparison
- Desktop (Linux, Windows) and Cloud (Docker, Kubernetes) operation
- Flexibility and maintainability
# - Throughput time and cost effectiveness

** Purpose
This document demonstrates the build and configuration process with INTENS
and the sample application SCIM which can be used to analyze the short-circuit
characteristics of induction motors.

#+CAPTION: Main Dialog Window of SCIM Application
#+NAME:   fig:main-dialog
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 500px :align center
[[./images/screenshots/scim-mainWindow.png]]

The application can be run in three different environments:

1. Linux or Windows desktop using a Qt user interface
2. Docker using a web browser interface
3. Kubernetes Cloud using a web browser interface

** Calculation Interface and Data Model
The calculation modules are already implemented both as a python and a
matlab function having the following interface:
#+begin_src matlab
function result = imsc(motor, short_circuit)
#+end_src

This function ~imsc~ has 2 input parameters and returns a
result. Their data types are structures, that contain scalar values,
vectors and matrices. The following tables describe their structure
in more detail.

- Induction Motor ~motor~:
| Property | Unit  | Description                         |

** Prerequisites

This demo project can be built on a Linux/Unix or Windows system with the
following packages installed:

- Intens 5 (with REST-DB-Server)
- Python 3.12 (virtualenv)
- Java (JRE) 17
- CMake (Version >3.10, for Windows, see special information in appendix [[*Installation on Windows]])
- MinGW/MSys (on Windows only, see appendix [[*Installation on Windows]])

The installation process for these packages on Linux/Unix systems is
straightforward. (see appendix [[*Installation on Linux]]).

In addition to the above listed software the
database service must be installed and started
with a special installation script. The description of these steps
can be found in section [[*Database Installation]].

It is assumed that the reader has some basic knowledge of the bash
shell and a text editor such as Emacs (recommended) or Vi.

** Demo Application Architecture
The demo application is developed with the Intens framework. Each
intens application has its own configuration which is
interpreted at startup by the parser.


#+CAPTION: SCIM Application Architecture
#+NAME:   fig:app-architecture
[[./images/Scim-Architecture.drawio.png]]

This application is composed of

- the *Intens* core module which provides the user interface and communicates with
  - the 2 external calculation modules: ~scim_calc.py~, ~scim_calc.m~ and
  - the *api-gateway* that delegates the calculation command to the ~scim_calc~ function and
  - the *DB-Service* with Spring REST, a RDBMS database (H2) and a dashboard
- the *configuration* file which describes the required interfaces,
  the controller logic, the UI layout and the data to be managed.

We will use the Intens generator ~intens-gen~ to create the necessary components
(Motor and ShortCircuit) for the application. For each component a sub-folder
is created in the ~etc/~ directory with the name of the component, e.g. a motor component:

#+begin_example
scim
📁 etc
    📁 motor
       📄 motor_datapool.inc
       📄 motor_functions.inc
       📄 motor_uiManager.inc
       📄 motor_streamer.inc
       📄 motor_operator.inc
#+end_example

In this getting-started guide the only files in the ~etc/motor~ directory that need to be
modified are ~motor_datapool.inc~ and ~motor_uiManager.inc~.

The final result can be downloaded from [[https://owncloud.semafor.ch/s/f0sTdM9gKZh61q4/download]]

** Database Installation
1. Create a new project directory:
  #+begin_example
  $ mkdir intens-training
  $ cd intens-training
  #+end_example
2. Download the DB server from https://owncloud.semafor.ch/s/B1RWj71nvPNO89t/download (100 MB)
  and unpack the file:
  #+begin_example
  ~/intens-training $ tar -xf workbook.tgz
  #+end_example
3. Start the Database Service
  - for Linux (and MinGW/MSys): ~$ java -jar workbook.jar~
  - for Windows: make sure java is installed (see [[*Java]]), then double-click on workbook.jar.
  Or start it from the command line as shown above.

*** Database configuration
The database itself offers many options to configure its behavior.
These options can be configured in various ways.

The easiest way to configure them is via a config file that
 will be loaded from the current working directory at startup of the service.
The name of the config file is either ~application.properties~ or ~application.yaml~
depending on the preferred file format.
A simple example properties file is provided in the template you will generate later
with the ~intens-gen~ command.

Here are some examples for different database configurations in properties file format:

- H2:
#+begin_example
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:file:./workbookdb;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1
spring.datasource.username=sa
spring.datasource.password=
#+end_example

- Postgres:
#+begin_example
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/scimdb
spring.datasource.username=postgres
spring.datasource.password=1234
#+end_example

- SQLServer:
#+begin_example
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:sqlserver://localhost:1433;databaseName=scim-db
spring.datasource.username=sa
spring.datasource.password=1234
#+end_example

- Mysql:
#+begin_example
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/database_scim
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=
#+end_example
*** User Creation
The database access is restricted to authorized users only. The database service
uses Spring Security and offers 2 methods for Identity and Access Management (IAM):
- JWT with username and password
- OAuth2 with an authorization service (such as Keycloak)
Here we will focus on the JWT method.

Open http://localhost:8080/workbook in your browser (Firefox, Google Chrome):
#+CAPTION: Database Login Screen
#+NAME:   fig:database-login
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 400px :align center
[[./images/screenshots/dashboard-login.png]]

- Login with Username/Pasword: admin/admin
#+CAPTION: Database Service Dashboard
#+NAME:   fig:database-dashboard
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 400px :align center
[[./images/screenshots/dashboard-home.png]]

- Press Button *Users*
#+CAPTION: Database User Administration
#+NAME:   fig:database-user-admin
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 400px :align center
[[./images/screenshots/dashboard-users.png]]

A user must have an active group, with the ~ROLE_USER~. When a component is created,
it is owned by the current user and its active group.
These settings, along with a component's approval state,
determine the accessability of the component.
A user may be member of multiple groups to get access permissions
to components of other groups.

To create a group, enter the group name in the field
~Group name~ and confirm with ~Add~.

** The Development Environment

Intens has support for a bunch of development tooling, including [[https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/][Tree-sitter]]
and [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/][Language Sever Protocol]].

Any editor that supports these can be set up to make use of these features, but we provide extensions for Emacs and VSCode.

*** Emacs (Recommended)

To use Emacs with the Intens tooling, simply load the intens-ts-mode.el file provided with Intens like this:

#+begin_example
(add-to-list 'load-path "/usr/local/intens/current/etc")
(load "intens-ts-mode")
#+end_example

Replace the path to your Intens install if it differs.
With this loaded, Emacs should be ready to use Tree-sitter and the Intens Language Server.

The next time you open an intens description file, it will have syntax highlighting provided by Tree-sitter.
If you have configured [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eglot.html][Eglot]] in your Emacs, it will also provide
auto completion, go to definition, and syntax error highlighting.

*** VSCode

For VSCode we provide an extension that lets VSCode use syntax highlighting and various Language Server features.
The *INTENS Tools* extension then has options to specify the Intens install to use.

If Intens and all the build tools already are in your PATH, it should work out of the box.
Otherwise, in the Settings menu of VSCode you will find the *Intens Installation* and *Intens Msys* settings.

*Intens Installation* points to the directory where you have Intens installed. (The directory with bin, etc, templates)

*Intens Msys* points to your Msys installation. (Default is C:\msys64)

** CMake

For maintainability reasons the Intens configuration is
typically split into several files which are merged together
during the build process. To provide a robust and portable environment
the build process is based on the *CMake* tool.

CMake is a popular open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to build,
test and package software.
CMake is used to control the software compilation process using simple platform and
compiler independent configuration files, and generate native makefiles and workspaces
that can be used in the compiler environment of your choice.
More information here: [[https://cmake.org]]

* Building
For building the application we will follow the
process depicted in this figure:

#+CAPTION: Intens Build Process
#+NAME:   fig:build-process
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 600px :align center
[[./images/figs/process.png]]

It would be perfectly appropriate to create the configuration files
completely using your preferred text editor or IDE. However as there are
several boiler-plate parts
in this configuration the application generator script ~intens-gen~
is included in the INTENS development package and will be used here.

In the following steps we are going to define

- the data elements of the input and output data
- the dialog windows
- the calculation interface

The database interface (the REST-service requests)
will be automatically created by the intens generator.

** Setup Application Folder
Startup your shell. Before proceeding please make sure
your PATH-Variable includes the intens bin folder.
- Add intens bin folder to your PATH variable:
#+begin_example
PATH=$PATH:<installed_intens_directory>/bin
#+end_example
- Create a virtual environment with venv: This is used to manage python packages
  for different projects. Using venv allows you to avoid installing python packages globally
  which could break system tools or other projects. Make sure python3 is in your PATH when exec python.
#+begin_example
~/intens-training $ python -m venv training
~/intens-training $ source training/bin/activate
(training) ~/intens-training $
#+end_example
  On Windows, the activate file is placed in the folder 'Scripts' instead of 'bin'.
#+begin_example
~/intens-training $ source training/Scripts/activate
#+end_example
  The above command activates the python virtual environment named ``training'', and the string
  ``(training)'' in your shell prompt keeps you informed about that.
- Install the required python packages:
  The required packages for a specific project should be maintained in a file,
  usually named as ~requirements.txt~. The following packages are required:
#+begin_example
Jinja2
lxml
Mako
PyInstaller
python-dateutil
pyzmq
requests
#+end_example
Install the python packages:
#+begin_example
(training) ~/intens-training $ pip install -r requirements.txt
#+end_example
** Create and Build the Base Application
Create the directory structure using the Intens application generator
#+begin_example
(training) ~/intens-training $ intens-gen --create application
#+end_example
~Identifier of the application (without blanks):~ *scim*\\
~application title [scim]:~ *Short Circuit Characteristics of Induction Motors*\\
~application title short name [SCIM]:~\\
~Destination directory of the application [/home/user/intens-training/scim]:~\\

The bold faced texts represent the user inputs. The default values are shown within brackets.

- Create the build folder and the Makefiles:
  In order to separate the build files from the source files it is a
  recommended practice to create a dedicated build folder:
#+begin_example
(training) ~/intens-training $ cd scim
(training) ~/intens-training/scim $ mkdir build
#+end_example
- Create the Makefiles by changing to the build folder and
  run configure:
#+begin_example
(training) ~/intens-training/scim $ cd build
(training) ~/intens-training/scim/build $ ../configure
#+end_example
  This command will populate the build tree with
  all required folders and Makefiles.
- Build the executable appplication:
#+begin_example
(training) ~/intens-training/scim/build $ make
#+end_example
** Run the Base Application
The created application can now be run and tested by invoking:
#+begin_example
(training) ~/intens-training/scim/build $ ./scripts/scim
#+end_example
The main window presents a menu bar and a fieldgroup for opening and
saving workbooks:

#+CAPTION: Main Dialog Window
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 500px :align center
[[./images/screenshots/scim-mainWindow1.png]]

However there are currently no components included in this
application. The next steps will add the motor component and the short-circuit data set.
Close the application and proceed.

The most relevant parts of the created directory tree are
#+begin_example

#+end_example
** Create the Motor Component
- Change to the project root and create the motor component with
  the Intens application generator:
#+begin_example
(training) ~/intens-training/scim/build $ cd ..
(training) ~/intens-training/scim $ intens-gen --create component
#+end_example
~Identifier of the component (without blanks):~ *motor*\\
~component type (without blanks) [Motor]:~\\
~component type label [Motor]:~\\
~component type label short name [MO]:~\\
~Destination directory of the application [/home/user/intens-training/scim]:~\\

Only the bold faced text needs to be entered.

The above command creates the new folder ~etc/motor~ populated with these five files:
#+begin_example
scim
📁 etc
   📁 motor
      📄 motor_datapool.inc
      📄 motor_functions.inc
      📄 motor_uiManager.inc
      📄 motor_streamer.inc
      📄 motor_operator.inc
#+end_example
- Open the file ~etc/motor/motor_datapool~ and include the data items in the Motor STRUCT block:
#+begin_src intens
  STRUCT Motor: Component {
    INTEGER {EDITABLE, SCALAR}
      p {
        LABEL=_("Pole pairs"),
        HELPTEXT=_("Number of pole pairs"),
        DBUNIT="1"
      }
    ;
    REAL {EDITABLE, SCALAR}
      psityp {
        LABEL=_("Nom. Flux"),
        HELPTEXT=_("Stator Type flux"),
        UNIT="Vs"
      },
      rs_Tref {
        LABEL=_("Stator Resistance"),
        HELPTEXT=_("Stator Resistance at 20 deg Celsius"),
        UNIT="Ω"
      },
      rr_Tref {
        LABEL=_("Rotor Resistance"),
        HELPTEXT=_("Rotor Resistance at 20 deg Celsius"),
        UNIT="Ω"
      },
      Lls {
        LABEL=_("Stator Leakage"),
        HELPTEXT=_("Stator leakage inductance"),
        UNIT="mH",
        DBUNIT="H"
      },
      Lh {
        LABEL=_("Magnetizing Inductance"),
        HELPTEXT=_("Magnetizing inductance"),
        UNIT="mH",
        DBUNIT="H"
      },
      Llr {
        LABEL=_("Rotor Leakage"),
        HELPTEXT=_("Rotor leakage inductance"),
        UNIT="mH",
        DBUNIT="H"
      },
      rh {
        LABEL=_("Iron Resistance"),
        HELPTEXT=_("Resistance representing Iron Losses"),
        UNIT="Ω"
      },
      Iin {
        LABEL=_("Moment of Inertia"),
        HELPTEXT=_("Moment of Inertia of rotor"),
        UNIT="kg*m²"
      }
    ;
};
#+end_src
This defines the data structure for the motor.
  The following attributes can be used for the definition of the data types:
   | Name      | Description                                             |
   |-----------+---------------------------------------------------------|
   | TRANSIENT | item will be ignored in db transactions                 |
   | HELPTEXT  | defines a help text that is shown on mouse pointer over |
   | HIDDEN    | item will not be transferred in a JSON output           |
   |           | or to the Matlab workspace                              |
   | SCALAR    | item will be transferred as a scalar type in a          |
   |           | JSON output or to the Matlab workspace                  |
   | UNIT      | defines the unit string of the item                     |
   | DBUNIT    | defines the unit in the db (default is UNIT)            |

- Add the keyword ~SCALAR~ to the the motor declaration in the same file
  as we do only want to handle one motor:
#+begin_src intens
  Motor
    motor {
      LABEL=_("Motor"),
      PERSISTENT, SCALAR
    }
  ;
#+end_src
- Open the file ~motor_uiManager.inc~ and
  include the following lines
  into the ~FIELDGROUP motor_properties_fg~
#+begin_src intens
FIELDGROUP motor_properties_fg(
  LABEL(motor.p)        motor.p         UNIT(motor.p),
  LABEL(motor.psityp)   motor.psityp    UNIT(motor.psityp),
  LABEL(motor.rs_Tref)  motor.rs_Tref   UNIT(motor.rs_Tref),
  LABEL(motor.rr_Tref)  motor.rr_Tref   UNIT(motor.rr_Tref),
  LABEL(motor.Lls)      motor.Lls*1e3   UNIT(motor.Lls),
  LABEL(motor.Lh)       motor.Lh*1e3    UNIT(motor.Lh),
  LABEL(motor.rh)       motor.rh        UNIT(motor.rh),
  LABEL(motor.Llr)      motor.Llr*1e3   UNIT(motor.Llr),
  LABEL(motor.Iin)      motor.Iin       UNIT(motor.Iin)
);
#+end_src
  The above lines define the content of the UI container
  ~motor_properties.fg~.
  Dialogs can contain several types of UI containers such
  as fieldgroups, folders, tables, plots.
  Fieldgroups are UI containers that align their children
  horizontally and vertically like the cells of a chessboard.
  Horizontal lines are terminated by the character ','.

  Dialogs (~FORM~) contain a collection of containers that are again aligned
  horizontally and vertically. The collection is grouped by pairs of parentheses.
  Each pair toggles the direction of alignement starting with horizontal direction.

  The dialog ~motor_form~ includes 2 fieldgroups that are aligned vertically:
#+begin_src intens
FORM motor_form{_("Motor properties")}(
  (
    (
      motor_top_section_fg,
      motor_properties_fg
    )
  )
);
#+end_src
- Change again to the build folder, type make
  and startup the application:
#+begin_example
(training) ~/intens-training/scim $ cd build
(training) ~/intens-training/scim/build $ make && ./scripts/scim
#+end_example
- Open the form ~Motor properties~ which you find in the menu
  ~Forms~. The following dialog should be displayed:
#+CAPTION: Motor Properties
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 500px :align center
[[./images/screenshots/scim-motorProperties.png]]

Using this dialog you can now create, open or update motor components.
** Create the Short-Circuit as a Variant Data Set
In contrast to the motor the short-circuit data has no identity and therefor
cannot be modeled as a component. We attach it to the variant:
#+begin_example
(training) ~/intens-training/scim/build $ cd ..
(training) ~/intens-training/scim $ intens-gen --create variant
#+end_example
~Identifier of the variant (without blanks):~ *short\under{}circuit*\\
~variant type (without blanks) [ShortCircuit]:~\\
~component type label [Short Circuit]:~\\
~component type label short name [SC]:~\\
~Destination directory of the application [/home/user/intens-training/scim]:~\\

Only the bold faced text needs to be entered.

The above command creates the new folder ~etc/short_circuit~ populated with
  the uiManager and functions file and adds VariantShortCircuit to the variant datapool:
#+begin_example
scim
📁 etc
   📁 variant
   │  📄 variant_uiManager.inc
   │     ...
   │
   📁 short_circuit
      📄 short_circuit_uiManager.inc
      📄 short_circuit_functions.inc
#+end_example
- Open the file ~etc/variant/variant_datapool.inc~
  and insert the following lines to the VariantShortCircuit:
#+begin_src intens
STRUCT VariantShortCircuit  {
  INTEGER{EDITABLE, SCALAR}
    nsamples { LABEL=_("Number of samples") }
  ;
  REAL {EDITABLE, SCALAR}
    u1 {
      LABEL=_("Stator voltage"),
      HELPTEXT=_("stator maximum voltage"),
      UNIT="V"
    },
    psi {
      LABEL=_("Stator flux"),
      HELPTEXT=_("stator maximum flux"),
      UNIT="Vs"
    },
    tload {
      LABEL=_("Load Torque"),
      HELPTEXT=_("load torque at begin of short circuit"),
      UNIT="Nm"
    },

#+begin_example
(training) ~/intens-training/scim $ cd build
(training) ~/intens-training/scim/build $ make && ./scripts/scim
#+end_example
For debugging and development purposes it could be beneficial to separate the
execution of the api-gateway and intens.
This can be achieved using the command line arguments:
- ~-i~ do not start intens
- ~-a~ do not start api-gateway
You will need 2 console windows to execute the Intens app:
#+begin_example
(training) ~/intens-training/scim/build $ ./scripts/scim -i
(training) ~/intens-training/scim/build $ ./scripts/scim -a
#+end_example
Each of these processes can be stopped and restarted independently.
* Desktop
The following steps demonstrate a typical use case:
- edit input values and execute calculations
- modify values and compare results
- store the dataset (motor and short circuit parameters) into the database
** Edit Values and Execute Calculation
- Enter these values in the text fields of the motor and short circuit tab folders:
#+CAPTION: Motor Test Values
#+NAME:   fig:input-motor
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 400px :align center
[[./images/screenshots/scim-input-motor.png]]
#+CAPTION: Short Circuit Test Values
#+NAME:   fig:input-short-circuit
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 400px :align center
[[./images/screenshots/scim-input-shortCircuit.png]]

-  Invoke the calculation functions by activating one of the
  buttons ~Calculate (Python)~, ~Calculate (Matlab)~ or ~Calculate (api-gateway)~
  All functions should return the same values. (However there is a small
  variation with the phase currents due to the different numerical
  integration used by python and matlab)

#+CAPTION: Calculation Results
#+NAME:   fig:results
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 600px :align center
[[./images/screenshots/scim-results.png]]
** Compare Results
Engineering is typically a highly iterative process.
During the design of a system or component usually a couple of calculations
with varying inputs are executed. When a input value is modified, Intens
informs the user that the corresponding results will be deleted.

#+caption: Consistency Check Dialog
#+attr_html: :width 500px :align center
[[./images/screenshots/scim-consistency-check.png]]

To keep these values for a later comparison a new version (or case) can be created
by pressing the New button on the bottom line of the dialog window.

A new dialog window CaseDialog asking for a case name will be shown:
#+caption: Case Dialog
#+attr_html: :width 500px :align center
[[./images/screenshots/scim-new-case.png]]

Enter a name for the new case (or accept the default) and press ~OK~.
This will create a copy of all values in the current user session.
Now a new calculation can be invoked. This procedure can be repeated
as often as required. The navigation between these cases is done with the arrow buttons
on the bottom of the dialog. More functions can be found in the ~CaseDialog~ that is opened via
the Case menu under ~Options~.

A more advanced comparison feature is included in the plot diagrams. Pressing
the right button while the pointer is over a plot area invokes an option menu
where one ore more cases can be selected:

#+caption: Compare Cases
#+attr_html: :width 500px :align center
[[./images/screenshots/scim-compare-case.png]]


** Store into Database
In order to store datasets the database must first be initialized. Enter the following command
in the console of your build directory:
#+begin_example
(training) ~/intens-training/scim/build $ make && make update-db
#+end_example

~2025-05-08 10:30:18,128 INFO: LogBook: 200~\\
~2025-05-08 10:30:18,161 INFO: Motor: 200~\\
~2025-05-08 10:30:18,192 INFO: Variant: 200~\\
~2025-05-08 10:30:18,205 INFO: Project: 200~\\
~2025-05-08 10:30:18,205 INFO: TOTAL success 4 failed 0~\\
~Built target update-db~

- In the main window enter the workbook and variant description and save the workbook
  by pressing the disk icon on the right with your mouse pointer:
#+caption: Database operation
#+attr_html: :width 600px :align center
[[./images/screenshots/scim-workbook.png]]

- Activate the button ~Workbook~ on the left which will open the workbook overview dialog:

#+caption: Project and Variants
#+attr_html: :width 600px :align center
[[./images/screenshots/scim-workbookOverview.png]]

There are 2 trees visible in the overview tab.
The right tree shows the data set that is currently active, eg. is used
for the calculation. The left tree shows all variants and baselines of
the loaded workbook. The active dataset can be replaced by any of these
variants by simply dragging and dropping the respective folder from the
workbook tree on the left to the active dataset tree on the right.
** Testing with behave and allure
  Behavior-driven development (or BDD) is an agile software development technique that encourages
collaboration between developers, QA and non-technical or business participants in a software project.
behave uses tests written in a natural language style, backed up by python code.
(See i.E. [[https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html][Tutorial]] for more information on behave.)

*** Installation
#+begin_example
(training) ~/intens-training $ pip install behave allure-behave
#+end_example

Download from [https://allurereport.org/docs/install], unpack the file and
add the bin directory of the unpacked files to you ~PATH~ variable.

*** Features

A behave feature is a collection of scenarios found in a feature file. These files are stored in the folder
*{testing/features}*.

A scenario is a test case including input, actions and expected output.

The ~environment.py~ module in directory ~testing/features~ contains the functions
~before_scenario~ and ~after_scenario~. As their name suggests,
these functions are executed before and after each scenario.
(See [[https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html#environmental-controls][Environmental Controls]] for more information.)

The functions needed to communicate with Intens (using [[https://zguide.zeromq.org/][ZeroMQ]])
are imported from the file *testing/features/steps/intens/intensZMQ.py*.

Change the arguments of ~intens.login_database()~ to the username and password created in section
[[*User Creation]].

Feature Files: A feature file has a natural language format describing a feature (or part of it)
with representative examples of expected outcomes:

*** Steps
A scenario has (one or) several steps *Given*, *When*, *Then*.
Each step is mapped to a python step implementation. behave looks for these implementations in
the python files stored in the folder *features/steps*.
#+begin_src python -n 14 -r
  @given("SCIM is running")         (ref:given)
  def step_impl(context):
  intens.hello()
#+END_SRC
Line [[(given)]] maps the following step from the feature file *scim.feature*:
#+begin_example
  Given SCIM is running
#+end_example
#+begin_src python -n 35 -r
@given("project {index} is selected") (ref:proj)
@when("project {index} is selected")
def step_select_project(context, index):
    intens.call_process("project_select_list_func", get_string(index), "ACTIVATE")
#+END_SRC

The ~@given~, ~@when~, and ~@then~ decorators correspond to the steps defined in the
feature file. You can use all of them when writing step definitions to handle
scenarios where the same step appears with different parameters. This approach
helps avoid code duplication and promotes reusability.

Line [[(proj)]] maps the step
#+begin_example
  Given ...
    And project 0 is selected
#+end_example

Line 36 maps the step
#+begin_example
  When ...
   And project 0 is selected
#+end_example

*** Running the tests
#+begin_example
(training) ~/intens-training $ cd scim/testing
(training) ~/intens-training $ behave -f allure_behave.formatter:AllureFormatter -o reports
(training) ~/intens-training $ allure serve reports
#+end_example

These commands run the tests and show the test report.

In line 2, behave is told to write the results to the folder reports, formatted for allure.

Line 3 calls [[https://docs.qameta.io/allure/][allure]], a tool to create test reports.
The test report should open in your web browser. If it does not open automatically, you can
see the report visiting the url given in the terminal (i.E. *http://127.0.0.1:45043*.

* Web Application
** In a docker environment
When running in a docker runtime environment the user access is based on HTTP/S via a web browser and
each INTENS application is packed into a docker container.

#+caption: Intens Application Architecture in a Docker Environment
#+attr_html: :width 500px :align center
[[./images/docker-compose.drawio.png]]

The INTENS docker application system
consists of the following services each implemented as docker containers:

- traefik :: provides access to the webtens, workbook (dashboard) services,
- webtens :: manages authentication, session handling, browser communication
    (via HTTP/S, Websockets), view creation,
- config-controller :: creation of INTENS containers (scim)
    on a per user basis,
- workbook :: DB access (users, groups, projects, variants and components)
  with approval and configuration management,
- scim :: INTENS application with data pool, process control, ui handling,
- api-gateway :: calculation programs invocation,

Follow these steps to setup up and to run a INTENS application in docker:

(*Prerequisite*: The docker software package  [[https://docs.docker.com/desktop]]
  is installed on your system.)

1. In the build folder execute ~make docker-image~. (This builds the docker image
   "ghcr.io/semaforinformatik/scim".)
   Next change to the docker folder in the main project folder and execute the
   ~docker compose up~ command.
   Make sure no other rest service or other process is running on port 8080.

   #+begin_example
(training) ~/intens-training/scim $ cd build
(training) ~/intens-training/scim/build $ make docker-image
(training) ~/intens-training/scim/build $ cd ../docker
(training) ~/intens-training/scim/docker $ docker compose up -d --build
#+end_example
   The console output of ~docker compose up~ should show the status "Started" for all services:

   ~✔ Container docker-traefik-1         Started            0.2s~\\
   ~✔ Container docker-webtens-1         Started            0.2s~\\
   ~✔ Container docker-config-service-1  Started            0.2s~\\
   ~✔ Container docker-workbook-1        Started            0.2s~\\
   ~✔ Container docker-api-gw-1          Started            0.2s~\\

2. Add a new user, using the Workbook dashboard
  (follow the same steps as described in section [[*User Creation]])

3. With the new database again we must update the database. Change to the build folder,
  type make, update the database application:

  #+begin_example
  (training) ~/intens-training/scim $ cd build
  (training) ~/intens-training/scim/build $ make && make update-db
  #+end_example
  ~2025-05-08 10:30:18,128 INFO: LogBook: 200~\\
  ~2025-05-08 10:30:18,161 INFO: Motor: 200~\\
  ~2025-05-08 10:30:18,192 INFO: Variant: 200~\\
  ~2025-05-08 10:30:18,205 INFO: Project: 200~\\
  ~2025-05-08 10:30:18,205 INFO: TOTAL success 4 failed 0~\\
  ~Built target update-db~

4. Navigate to the start screen of the web interface in our web browser [[http://localhost:8080]]
  #+caption: Login Dialog
  #+attr_html: :width 600px :align center
  [[./images/screenshots/webtens-login.png]]

5. After Login to the Demo Application:

  Plot Screen
  #+caption: SCIM Plot Screen after Calculation
  #+attr_html: :width 600px :align center
  [[./images/screenshots/webtens-plot.png]]

6. Add custom CSS:
  To add custom styles or scripts to your webtens application,
  you can simply add the files into the folder ~/home/app/server/public~ folder via a volume mount.
  After that you have to set the environment variables ~CUSTOM_STYLES~ or ~CUSTOM_SCRIPTS~ to their path relative of the public folder.
  #+begin_example
  webtens:
    image: ghcr.io/semaforinformatik/webtens:latest
    expose:
      - 8000
    environment:
      - APP_NAME=SCIM latest
      - CONTAINER_TYPE=scim
      - CUSTOM_STYLES=scim/scim.css
      - SESSION_TIMEOUT=900
    volumes:
      - ../qss:/home/app/server/public/scim
  #+end_example

  Only singular js files are supported for scripts. For styles you can use a singular css file or an scss file importing multiple.

  Webtens will automatically load those additional styles/scripts on startup.

** Authentication and Authorization
Intens applications use JWT (JSON Web Token) by default for access authorization. The tokens are
created by webtens via a workbook login request. As an alternative OAuth2/OpenId Connect can be used
in which case an external SSO server must be available.
To use this a few environment variables in Webtens must be set:

| VARIABLE           | Description                      | Example                                     |
|--------------------+----------------------------------+---------------------------------------------|
| OIDC_ISSUER        | Issuer URL for the OIDC provider | https://keycloak.example.com/realms/semafor |
| OIDC_CLIENT        | Client name                      | webtens                                     |
| OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET | Client secret                    | password                                    |
| BASE_URL           | Full base URL of Webtens         | https://webtens.semafor.ch                  |

In addition the following environment variable must be set in the workbook service:

- spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.jwk-set-uri :: https://keycloak.example.com/auth/semafor/protocol/openid-connect/certs

It needs to point to the certificates endpoint of your SSO provider so the workbook can verify the user's tokens.

When using OAuth2 the workbook service will use the roles, groups and the active group provided by your SSO server.
The specific entries needed in your access token are the following:

- groups :: a list of group names
- resource_access -> account -> roles :: [USER, ADMIN]: USER to let the user access the workbook itself. ADMIN to make them a workbook admin
- active_group :: any from the groups key. Name must match fully

For details see [[*Keycloak group and active_group mappers]]

*** OAuth in desktop

OAuth login is also supported when running as a desktop application.
With the only configuration difference that the OIDC client in Keycloak
needs to be set to public access by disabling "Client authentication".

Intens requires two command line arguments to use OIDC, with the client name being specified before the url in the first one:
#+begin_example
  --oauth "https://scim@keycloak.example.com/realms/semafor/protocol/openid-connect/auth" \
  --oauthAccessTokenUrl "https://keycloak.example.com/realms/semafor/protocol/openid-connect/token" \
#+end_example


** Deploying to the cloud

#+caption: Intens Application Architecture in a Kubernetes Cloud
#+attr_html: :width 500px :align center
[[./images/k8s-scim.drawio.png]]

Prerequisites:
- Access to a kubernetes cluster (docker desktop, [[https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io]], [[https://k3d.io]] ..)
- The kubectl tool [[https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools]] (already included in docker desktop)
- The helm package manager for kubernetes [[https://helm.sh]]
- The Skaffold command line tool for easy kubernetes development [[https://skaffold.dev/]]

To deploy and develop our application in a kubernetes powered cloud, we use helm and skaffold.
Since kubernetes itself is very complex and has a steep learning curve, we provide
an easier way to deploy the application and its dependencies via helm charts.
A helm chart is a package that gives you an easier to use interface to deploy the app,
with the complexities hidden away.
To learn more about helm, the helm website linked above has all the documentation you need.

*** Semafor Helm Registry

You will need to use a few helm charts that are stored in our external helm registry.
To add our registry use the following command:
#+begin_example
$ helm repo add semafor https://charts.semafor.ch
#+end_example

**** Available config files

Navigate to the "helm" directory in the project root.
This directory contains the charts for our intens application, the api-gateway,
and configuration files for the webtens and config-controller charts.
The workbook subdirectory contains a values file for the workbook and the stuff
to tell the generic workbook chart about our database schema.

Since the webtens, config-controller and workbook parts work the same
regardless of application, they are stored in an external repository
with only the configuration files in the directory. These config files work as follows:

- config-controller.yaml :: The intensApps value contains a list of apps with the
  first name being the one given to the webtens chart,
  and the second name being the one given to the chart of the intens app.
  In most cases these two names are equal.
  This configuration has only our one scim app in its config,
  but for larger multi-app deployments, the config can support an arbitrary amount of intens applications.
#+begin_example
intensApps:
  scim-intens: scim-intens
#+end_example
- webtens.yaml :: The appName value is the value that will end up being displayed on the login page of the app.
  appType specifies what app the webtens instance should ask for at the config-controller.
  This value should be equivalent to the one in the config-controller file.
  The baseUrl can be localhost for development, but has to be changed in an actual deployment
  as the web application redirects all request to it.
#+begin_example
appName: SCIM
appType: scim-intens
baseUrl: http://localhost:8000
#+end_example
- workbook/values.yaml :: The workbook values file is a bit bigger, but we don't need a big part of it for basic usage.
  For brevity, the file shown here only has the important parts that we need for this explanation.
  - The datasource section describes our database connection.
    Its url is formatted as a jdbc database url. Please consult your specific database's documentation for the correct format.
  - The username and password fields are as expected, the login data for your database if needed.
  - The metrics field toggles the endpoint for metrics via [[https://prometheus.io/]] and if your cluster has
    prometheus already configured to collect metrics.
  - The oidc section is for setting up authentication via identity provider. Consult your identity provider's documentation
    for more details.
#+begin_example
datasource:
  url: jdbc:h2:file:/tmp/db/data
  username:
  password:
metrics:
  enabled: false
oidc:
  enabled: false
  # issuer:
  # client:
  # clientSecret:
  # certificates:
#+end_example
**** Project helm charts
The folder "intens-app", in our helm directory, is the helm chart for the the app itself.
Since these settings are very specific to the project needs, the chart is stored in here instead of an external repository.

For a typical intens app the required configuration is included so you won't need to look into the chart itself,
but it's useful to have at least a basic understanding of its content.

The most important file in the intens-app chart can be found under "templates/statefulset.yaml".
This chart defines the intens service itself and is where you can change settings for the application and the api-gateway.

Settings include things like open ports, environment variables or even adding additional services if needed.

*** Skaffold
Skaffold is a CLI tool to simplify the process of building, developing and deploying your kubernetes app.
All settings related to skaffold can be found in the "skaffold.yaml" file in the project root.

The two important sections in that file are the "build" and "deploy" sections.

In the build section we tell skaffold what images to build and how to build them.
There are different options, but the simplest one, that we use here, is just specifying a Dockerfile.

In the deploy section we specify how the app and its dependencies are deployed.
In this case we specified that with helm charts.
The helm charts can be local or remote, with a version specified.
You can also customize the helm charts here via setting the values.

How to use the tool to deploy to a cluster will be explained in the next part.

*** Deploying to a cluster

This section assumes you have a kubernetes cluster and skaffold set up with a docker image repo.
If you don't have that set up, please consult the documentation for skaffold:
https://skaffold.dev/docs/quickstart/
and for minikube to get a local development cluster https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io.

To build and deploy your images, go into the root folder and execute the skaffold command with the run argument.

#+begin_example
$ skaffold run
#+end_example
This will take a while while it builds and deploys the application, but once the command is
finished you should be able to list all the running
kubernetes pods and see your application running in the cluster.

The output of the command ~kubectl get pods~ should then show all pods as running:
#+begin_example
NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
config-controller-bd8fb547-6q699   1/1     Running   0          87s
scim-intens-0                      2/2     Running   0          87s
webtens-79c95ff6c9-k5cbz           1/1     Running   0          86s
workbook-6f4966984-rr4dl           1/1     Running   0          86s
#+end_example

*** Redis
Redis is used as a session store to improve session handling and runtime scaling of the Webtens server
(for more information visit [[https://redis.io]])

To activate the usage of Redis, the following environment variables are used:
#+begin_example
REDIS_HOST
REDIS_PORT
REDIS_PASSWORD
#+end_example
If you use the default port for Redis you can omit that variable.
Same with the password if you have auth disabled for Redis.

** Webtens Testing with Behave

Create the directory where all testing files will be stored by using the following commands:

#+begin_example
(training) ~/intens-training $  cd testing
(training) ~/intens-training $  mkdir webtesting
(training) ~/intens-training/testing $  cd webtesting
(training) ~/intens-training/testing/webtesting $ wget https://owncloud.semafor.ch/s/DnE3mx17s2GgrSq/download -O - | tar xzf -
(training) ~/intens-training/testing/webtesting $ cd behave
#+end_example


Now install the Python packages from the requirements.txt and run the Behave
  test
#+begin_example
(training) ~/intens-training/testing/webtesting $ pip install -r requirements.txt
(training) ~/intens-training/testing/webtesting $ behave -f allure_behave.formatter:AllureFormatter -o reports
#+end_example
#+CAPTION: Allure Report
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 500px :align center
  [[./images/screenshots/selenium-allure.png]]

  The test report should open in your web browser. If it does not open automatically, you can
see the report visiting the url given in the terminal (i.E. *http://127.0.0.1:45043*).

* Data Management
** Data Model
The database access is implemented by a REST service which is connected
to a SQL or NOSQL database. The data model comprises 3 main types
of entities:

- Workbook (Project) :: a collection of variants that serve a common engineering goal.
  Each workbook has a unique name, an optional set of properties, an owner and a visibility state
  (local, global, obsolete).
- Variants :: a collection of components used for specific calculation tasks. Each variant
  has a name which is unique within its workbook, an owner, an approval state
  and an optional set of properties.
- Components :: persistent objects each having a type, a name, a revision number,
  an owner,  an approval state and a set of type specific properties. The same component
  can be attached to several variants. Each component is identified by its type, name
  and revision. The component types have a unique name and a set of property types
  which each have a unique name, a physical unit and a data type (~STRING~, ~INTEGER~, ~REAL~, ~DATE~, ~CDATA~)
  and 0 (scalar) or more dimensions (array).

#+CAPTION: Intens Data Model
#+NAME:   fig:data-model
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 500px :align center
[[./images/intens-db-model.drawio.png]]

Modifications of property values are saved with timestamp, user name and change comment
such that the changes are traceable and the version of components and variants
can be restored.

This model is known as
  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93attribute%E2%80%93value_model][Entity-Attribute-Value Model (EAV)]].

The database service is based on [[https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot][Spring Boot]] using Spring Security, Spring MVC/REST, Data/JPA and
[[https://www.liquibase.org/][Liquibase]] for the database schema change management.

To prevent interferencies of concurrent modifications an
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control][Optimistic Concurrency Control]] is implemented. If a conflict occurs
it will be detected and the save operation will be aborted with an ``Up-to-date Conflict'' message.

* Appendix
** Installation on Windows
The following sections describe the installation and setup of an Intens
development environment on Windows.
It is not necessary for executing Intens applications.

*** MSYS2 and MinGW
MinGW ("Minimalist GNU for Windows"), is a free and open source software development
environment to create Microsoft Windows applications. It includes also the MSYS2 command shell.

- Download and run the latest MSYS2 64bit Setup:
  [[https://www.msys2.org]]

- Start the MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit Shell and use the package manager (pacman) to
  update the packages:
  #+begin_example
  pacman -Syu
  #+end_example
  Remove deprecated packages (if any)
  #+begin_example
  pacman -Qm
  #+end_example
- Install the development tools:
  #+begin_example
  pacman -S git base-devel mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake
  #+end_example

*** Python
On windows systems the official distribution is recommended:
      [[https://www.python.org/downloads]]

Note: You need administrator permissions on Windows for the installation.

- Edit ~/.bash_profile~ in your mingw home directory and add the PATH:
  #+begin_example
  export PATH=/C/Python/Python313/:$PATH
  #+end_example
  Note: check and correct the path to reflect your python installation directory.

*** Java
Java (Runtime Environment) is needed for the database service.
Check if Java is already installed on your system:
#+begin_example
java -version
#+end_example
(Note: version 17 or newer is required). Download a Java/JRE installer
if no such version is installed. There are multiple providers such as:
[[https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases]]

** Installation on Linux
For debian/ubuntu based systems:

- Download the DEB-File from https://github.com/SEMAFORInformatik/intens/releases/ and install Intens:
  #+begin_example
  sudo apt-get install ./semafor-intens-6.0.2-ubuntu-24.04-x86-64.deb
  #+end_example
  This will install the files in /usr/local/intens.
- Add the intens bin directory to your PATH:
  #+begin_example
  PATH=/usr/local/intens/6.0.2/bin:$PATH
  #+end_example
- Install the development packages
  #+begin_example
  sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake python3-mako python3-venv \
    python-is-python3 default-jdk gettext
  #+end_example
- If you're working with Emacs add the following lines to your
    emacs config:
  #+begin_example
    (add-to-list 'load-path "/usr/local/intens/6.0.2/etc")
    (require 'intens-ts-mode)
  #+end_example

** Coding Conventions
To improve the readability of the source code and
make software maintenance easier at set of guidelines
should be followed.

As our basis we've chosen the [[https://pep8.org]]
(PEP 8 Style Guide for Python Code) with some pragmatic adaptions:

- Use 2 spaces per identation level.
- Use Spaces and not Tabs.
- Keep the line lengths below 80 characters.
- Avoid extraneous whitespace.
- Struct names should use the CapWords convention.
- Names of functions and variables should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores.
- Constants are written in all capital letters with underscores separating words.

** Internationalization (I18n) and Localization (L10n)
Intens applications can be adapted to differented languages and regions without
code modifications. This is based on the tool GNU gettext https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext

The following steps create a German translation of SCIM.

*** Prepare the sources
All strings you want to translate need to be embraced by ~_("...")~.
#+begin_src intens
SET projectStatus_set (
  _("Local") = "local"
, _("Division") = "division"
, _("Global") = "global"
, _("Delivered") = "delivered"
, _("Obsolete") = "obsolete"
);
#+end_src
In the file CMakeLists.txt modify ~copyright-holder~ and ~msgid-bugs-address~:
#+begin_example
configure_gettext(
    ...
    XGETTEXT_ARGS
        ...
        "--copyright-holder=COPYRIGHT HOLDER"
        "--msgid-bugs-address=bugs@example.com"

#+end_example
Add all relevant source files to the SOURCES list:
#+begin_example
configure_gettext(
    ...
    SOURCES
        ...
        "etc/calculation_interface.inc"
        ...
#+end_example
Add the language ~de~ to the list of languages in the file:
#+begin_example
configure_gettext(
    ...
    LANGUAGES "en_US" "de"
    ...
#+end_example
*** Translation
Before you can do the translation of the strings,
you need to create the template file ~po/scim.pot~ and the language file ~po/de/scim.po~:
#+begin_example
$ ~/intens-training/scim/build: make update-po
#+end_example
This will generate the pot, po and gmo files in the po directory:
#+begin_example
📁 po
    📁 de
       📄 scim.gmo
       📄 scim.po
    📁 en_US
       📄 scim.gmo
       📄 scim.po
    📄 Gettext_helpers.cmake
    📄 LICENSE
    📄 scim.pot
#+end_example

Next, set charset to ~UTF-8~ in ~po/de/scim.po~:
#+begin_example
...
"Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n"
...
#+end_example

Now you can translate the strings to German (~po/de/scim.po~), using Emacs, Poedit, ...:
#+begin_example
...
msgid "Workbook"
msgstr "Arbeitsmappe"
...
msgid "Pole pairs"
msgstr "Polpaare"
...
#+end_example
*** Build binary language files
As the last step, you need to build and install the binary language file and install it to the right place.

The cmake target ~update-po~ was used before to create the template file ~po/scim.pot~ and
the language file ~po/de/scim.po~. It is also used to update these files and to create the binary
language file ~po/de/scim.gmo~. Therefore, use it again now:
#+begin_example
$ ~/intens-training/scim/build: make update-po
#+end_example

Finally, you need to install the binary language file to the path where it is found by INTENS.

When the application is started from the shell using
#+begin_example
$ ~/intens-training/scim/build: ./scripts/scim
#+end_example
the path is ~share/locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/scim.mo~.

Use the following install command to create it:
#+begin_example
$ build: cmake --install . --prefix . --component translation
#+end_example

*** Start the translated application
INTENS needs to know the language you want to be used. This is done using
the environment variable ~LC_MESSAGES~ (Linux) or ~LANG~ (Windows).

Set value of that variable to an available locale.
To get a list of available German locales, type:
#+begin_example
$ ~/intens-training/scim/build: locale -a | grep de
#+end_example

Set the language in the start script ~scripts/scim~
#+begin_example
if [ $OSTYPE == "linux-gnu" ]; then
  export LC_MESSAGES=de_CH.utf8
else
  LANG="de
fi
#+end_example
Now, start scim with German translations:
#+begin_example
$ ~/intens-training/scim/build: make && ./scripts/scim
#+end_example

** Keycloak group and active_group mappers

By default, groups aren't mapped to a token and active_group is a custom property which also needs mapping.

First we need to add the active_group attribute to our user profile.
You can find the attributes of a user profile in *Realm settings > User profile*. Here you add the attribute activeGroup.

The Active Group attribute is defined as follows:
#+CAPTION: Active Group attribute
#+NAME:   fig:keycloak-active-group-attribute
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 300px :align center
[[./images/screenshots/scim-keycloak4.png]]

This attribute must be set for each user, but we still need the scopes and mappers to include them in the token.
To map groups into a token, we need to create a new client scope:

#+CAPTION: Creating a groups client scope
#+NAME:   fig:keycloak-scim-client-scope-groups
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 250px :align center
[[./images/screenshots/scim-keycloak5.png]]

With this scope created, we need to configure some mappers.
First we want to create one for the groups. Go to the newly created scope's mappers tab and click "Configure a new mapper".

In the opened dialog window, select *Group Membership* as the type and configure it as follows:
#+CAPTION: Group mapper
#+NAME:   fig:keycloak-scim-client-scope-groups-mapper
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 250px :align center
[[./images/screenshots/scim-keycloak6.png]]

After that, create another mapper (*By configuration*), select *User Attribute* as its type and configure it as follows:
#+CAPTION: Active group mapper
#+NAME:   fig:keycloak-scim-client-scope-activegroups-mapper
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 250px :align center
[[./images/screenshots/scim-keycloak7.png]]

You should now have two mappers. Next you need to activate those in your client.
Open your client's settings and go to "Client scopes".
In that menu, add your newly created scope and put its assigned type as "Default".
#+CAPTION: SCIM client scopes
#+NAME:   fig:keycloak-scim-client-scopes
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 500px :align center
[[./images/screenshots/scim-keycloak8.png]]
