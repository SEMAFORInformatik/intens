# Welcome to Intens

INTENS is an integration platform that improves the engineering processes by making them more flexible, efficient and reliable.
 It is in daily operation by various renowned engineering companies since more than 10 years.

INTENS adheres to well known and established architecture patterns that lead to loosely coupled and
  highly maintainable application systems.

The INTENS core architecture implies a clear separation between the presentation and the domain layer which includes
the customer specific modules, the project data and the configuration.

INTENS based systems can be run as pure desktop applications on Linux and Windows hosts or as
cloud native application being accessible by any modern browser (Firefox, Chrome, Safari etc.)

## Build

The build process uses cmake on a Linux system. Note since intens
includes the submodules jwt-cpp and rapidjson, this repo must be cloned with
the option `--recurse-submodules`. Otherwise the submodules must be activated
after cloning with the following commands:

```
  $ git submodule init
  $ git submodule update --init --recursive
```
Build and install a debug intens:

 * configure: `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -B build -S .`
 * build:     `cmake --build build -j10`
 * install:   `sudo cmake --install build`

These commands create the folder build, compile and link intens in it and
install intens to `/usr/local/intens/<version>`.

For windows (using docker image dockcross with https://mxe.cc) :
 * shared: `dockcross/build-windows-release.sh`
