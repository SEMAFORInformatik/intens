\index{UI\_MANAGER@\UIMANAGER}
The \UIMANAGER{} block defines the appearance of the user interface
without having the system administrator
to place the interface objects geometrically. \INTENS{} places
the text fields, plots, tables, buttons etc.
automatically after calculating their sizes.

NOTE:  Due to this feature, the layout of the windows may look
slightly different after changing the language.

\input{diagrams/ui_manager_description}

An \INTENS{}-application usually has a main window with a menubar and
several user defined forms.
Each form may contain any number of horizontally
and vertically arranged fieldgroups, text
and plot windows and folder groups.
Its layout is defined within a form declaration.
Each pair of paranthesis toggles the orientation
starting with a vertical orientation.
