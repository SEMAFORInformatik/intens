\subsubsection{Message Queue}
\label{sec:opmessagequeue}
Message Queues are used to communicate with other programs using ZeroMQ.
Each message can have multiple parts. The first part (\HEADER)
is used to identify the message.

The communication is done over TCP / IP.

Two patterns are implemented:
\begin{itemize}
\item \PUBLISH{} - \SUBSCRIBE{} \\
Asynchronous pattern. One process publishes. Subscribed processes receive the messages.
See \nameref{sec:opexamples:messagequeue:publishsubscribe}
on page \pageref{sec:opexamples:messagequeue:publishsubscribe}. \\[2ex]

\item \REQUEST{} - \REPLY{}\\
Synchronous pattern. One process sends a request to one other process.
Depending on the \HEADER, the request data is written to the \DATAPOOL{} using the given
\STREAM(s). \\
An optional function is called (if given). \\
The response (the given \RESPONSE{} \STREAM(s)) are then sent back. \\[2ex]
\end{itemize}

Message Queues can also be used to communicate with \PLUGIN s
(see section \nameref{sec:uiplugin} on page \pageref{sec:uiplugin}).
Requests can be sent to plugins and published messages can be subscribed to.
This is done using function statements.
See \nameref{dia:messagequeuestatement} on page \pageref{dia:messagequeuestatement}.

\PUBLISH{} and \REQUEST{} message queues are used by the \PUBLISH{} and \REQUEST{} function statements.
See \nameref{dia:messagequeuestatement} on page \pageref{dia:messagequeuestatement}.

\SUBSCRIBE{} message queues listen for messages on a \PORT{} on a \HOST{}.
They subscribe to one or more headers from a publisher (those they want to receive).
The message (data after the header) is written to the given \STREAM(s).
When a \FUNC tion is defined, it is called.
Every \HEADER{} has its own \STREAM (s) and \FUNC tion.

\REPLY{} message queues listen for requests on a local \PORT.
They reply to one or more headers.
The message (data after the header) is written to the given \REQUEST{} stream(s).
When a \FUNC tion is defined, it is called.
Finally, a response is sent (empty or defined by \RESPONSE{}).
Every \HEADER{} has its own \REQUEST (s), \FUNC tion and \RESPONSE (es).

\SUBSCRIBE{} and \REPLY: When a \FUNC tion is given, it is called after a message has arrived and its data is written
to the \DATAPOOL.

Note: Only one \FUNC tion runs at a time. When a message arrives (and a \FUNC tion is given), an already running function
delays the writing to the \DATAPOOL{} and the running of the \FUNC tion.

When a \PLUGIN{} is given, the received message is also forwarded to it.

The \HEADER s and the corresponding options are given in the
\nameref{dia:opmessagequeueheaderoption} on page \pageref{dia:opmessagequeueheaderoption}:

                        \PORT{} must be given. \\
\REQUEST              & Create a request message queue to send requests to another program.
                        \PORT{} must be given. \\

\HOST                 & \SUBSCRIBE{} or \REQUEST: Hostname where the other program listens. \newline
                        Defaults is ``localhost''. \newline
                        \SUBSCRIBE: Set \HOST{} to "" if it is not known yet or to delay subscribing.
                        Use \SETMQHOST{} to set the \HOST{} later

                        Number of seconds to wait for a connection to the receiver and its \RESPONSE. \newline
                        Default is 10 seconds. \newline
                        Set \TIMEOUT{} to 0 to have no \TIMEOUT. \\
